 *"Economists are commonly thought to believe that the operation of the free market should trump any considerations of social justice. This view is sustainable only if one subscribes to the naive view that real markets and other social systems only have one equilibrium. However, game theory shows that realistic social systems usually have many equilibria. It is therefore not enough to argue that people will strive to improve their individual welfare. Their behaviour needs to be coordinated so that they all end up playing the same equilibrium. I argue that fairness can be explained as one of nature's answers to such coordination problems. That is to say, fairness evolved as an equilibrium selection device."*

# Two simple examples
---
## The cliché

--

that is, The Prisoners' Dilemma:

<center><table border="0"><tr>
    <td align='center'>Pl 1. , Pl. 2</td>
    <th align='center'>cooperate</th>
    <th align='center'>defect</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th align='center'>cooperate</th>
    <td align='center'>  -1, -1</td>
    <td align='center'> -10, 0</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th align='center'>defect</th>
    <td align='center'>  0, -10</td>
    <td align='center'>  -9, -9</td>
</tr></table></center>

--

It can be shown that in the finitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma there exist a unique 
subgame-perfect equilibrium in which both players play 'Defect'.

--

*How would you play the game against me?*

--

But this is a stupid equilibrium; why?

--

But then again, how would I play the game against you?

--

It may appear we are moving in circles.

# So what do we need to achieve a better payoff for both players?

---

## Wait, let's look at another example

--

The Trust Game<sup>1</sup>:

<center><table border="0"><tr>
    <td align='center'>Pl 1. , Pl. 2</td>
    <th align='center'>pay</th>
    <th align='center'>don't pay</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th align='center'>deliver</th>
    <td align='center'>  2, 2</td>
    <td align='center'> 0, 4</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th align='center'>don't deliver</th>
    <td align='center'>  1, 0</td>
    <td align='center'>  1, 0</td>
</tr></table></center>

..is similar to the Hold up Problem economists talk about.

We ask again what's the rational way to play the game?

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

--

*"There are countries in Europe, of first-rate industrial capabilities, where the most serious impediment to conducting business concerns on a large scale, is the rarity of persons who are supposed fit to be trusted with the receipt and expenditure of large sums of money."*

John Stuart Mill, Principles of Political Economy, 1848

--

*"Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust, certainly any transaction conducted over a period of time. It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence..."*

Kenneth J. Arrow, Gifts and Exchanges, 1972

--

*"..the inability of societies to develop effective , low - cost enforcement of contracts is the most important source of both historical stagnation and contemporary underdevelopment in the Third World."*

Douglass C. North, Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance, 1990

# We can ask the same question: how does trust relate to economic outcomes?

## Hello World

Download **data** from [Github](https://github.com/quantumjazz/Game-Theory-and-Social-Norms-Slides/blob/master/data/trust_score_ranking.xlsx) or copy and paste the following link:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
https://github.com/quantumjazz/Game-Theory-and-Social-Norms
  -Slides/blob/master/data/trust_score_ranking.xlsx
```

--

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to.

- Just use **Excel** instead. A quick and dirty regression is all we need.

---

## The data


```{r trust, echo = TRUE}
head(trust)
```

--

The [trust](https://globaltrustresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/trust_score_ranking.xlsx) data (Bekkers, R. & Sandberg, B., Grading Generalized Trust Across Europe, 2019)  contains historical average for all countries in the dataset for the period 1953-2018. 

The [GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) contains historical average GDP per capita (current US$, 1960 - 2020) from the World Bank Databank.

**petrol** is a dummy variable; you can decide to use it ot not.

---
## Plot the data


```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.asp = 9/16,
  fig.align = 'center',
  echo = F,
  out.width = "95%",
  dpi= 300
)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = trust, mapping = aes(trust, gdp))+
  geom_point()
```

--

The data looks rather messy (as happens often in the real world) but we can see a linear relationship between trust and gdp per capita.

---

## The regression

We are regressing trust on both gdp and petrol; these are the results:

```{r comment='#'}
# a boring regression
fit = lm(trust ~ gdp + petrol, data = trust)
summary(fit)

```


---

## Discussion

**petrol** is not significant, but otherwise the results look good. 

--

We have an R-squared of .25; is this large or small?

--

What are the other determinants of gdp (wealth, prosperity)?
